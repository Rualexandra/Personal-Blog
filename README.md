# Personal-Blog

Hello this is my personal blog where I will showcase my thoughts and experiences. Feel free to test it out and take a look.

# How it works:

First load the app, you will then fill out the form and submit. Once it is submitted, the blog post data will be stored locally and you will be redirected to the posts page. However if you submit without the proper content being filled, a message will appear prompting you to complete the form. Once you view the posts page,
you will be presented with a header , with a light mode/dark mode toggle, and a "Back" button. If you click the light mode/dark mode toggle, the page content's styles updates to reflect the selection. If you click the "Back" button,
you will be redirected back to the landing page where you can input more blog entries.
The main content will present the viewer with a list of blog posts that are pulled from localStorage. This includes a JSON array of blog post objects, each including the post author's username, title of the post, and post's content.
If you take a closer look at a single blog entry in the list,
you can see the title, the content, and the author of the post.
In the footer, you will be presented with a link to the developer's portfolio.
